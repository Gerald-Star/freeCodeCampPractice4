        <h5>CSS Transform scale Property to Change the Size of an Element</h5>

        <p>To change the scale of an element, CSS has the transform property, 
            along with its scale() function. The following code example doubles 
            the size of all the paragraph elements on the page:
            
             the transform property. Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees.
            transform: rotate(-45degrees)
        </p>

        p {
         transform: scale(2);
        }

        <div class="ball" id= "ball1"></div>

        <div class="ball" id= "ball2"></div>

    </section>

    <p>From an earlier challenge that the box-shadow
         property takes values for offset-x, offset-y, blur-radius, 
         spread-radius and a color value in that order. The blur-radius and 
         spread-radius values are optional.</p>

    <div class="center"></div>

            One of the most popular shapes in the world is the heart shape, and 
            in this challenge you'll create one using pure CSS. But first, you 
            need to understand the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. 
            <br> <br>

            <em>::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child 
            of the selected element;  </em>
            <br> <br>

            <em>::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the 
            selected element. </em>
            
            In the following example, a ::before pseudo-element is used to add
             a rectangle to an element with the class heart:
            <br> <br>

            .heart::before {
             content: "";
            background-color: yellow;
            border-radius: 25%;
            position: absolute;
            height: 50px;
            width: 70px;
            top: -50px;
            left: 5px;
            }

            <strong>For the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to function properly, 
            they must have a defined content property.</strong> 
            
            This property is usually 
            used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. 
            When the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements are used to make shapes,
             the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty 
             string. 
             <br>
             <br>
             In the above example, the element with the class of heart has 
             a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with 
             height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border-radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

            Transform the element on the screen to a heart. In the .heart::after 
            selector, change the background-color to pink and the border-radius to 
            50%.

            Next, target the element with the class heart (just heart) and fill in 
            the transform property. Use the rotate() function with -45 degrees.

            <div class="heart"></div>
